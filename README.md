## Introduction
QuiMi is a mobile quiz application built with React Native and Expo, designed to provide an engaging, social trivia experience. Users can register, customize profiles, connect with friends, and challenge each other to quiz matches. Leveraging Firebase for authentication and Firestore for data management, QuiMi adopts a serverless architecture, allowing me to focus on frontend development. The app integrates the Open Trivia Database API for dynamic quiz content. This project aimed to explore mobile app development, game logic, and real-time data synchronization while delivering a user-friendly and visually appealing experience.
